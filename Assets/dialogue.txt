This is commander Harrison, pilot.
We have reports of hostile alien  behaviour.
Medium alien ship near system 0x1A4.
Your job is to find and destroy it, pilot.
Warping you in...
Use arrows to move around.
And space to shoot.
...
I think I warped you to the wrong system, pilot.
Give me some time to find the right coordinates.
...
Oh no...
Asteroid storm incoming!
Watch out! You have only one life, pilot.

Just a few moments!

Warping out!
