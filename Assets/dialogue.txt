This is commander Harrison, pilot.
We have reports of hostile alien behaviour.
Medium alien ship near system 0x1A4.
Your job is to find and destroy it, pilot.
Warping you in...
Use arrows to move around.
And space to shoot.
...
I think I warped you to the wrong system, pilot.
Give me some time to find the right coordinates.
...
Oh no, watch out! Asteroid storm incoming!
...
Hang in there pilot, I almost got it...
...
The asteroids are blocking my systems...
...
Keep breaking them, pilot!
...
We are almost there, pilot!
