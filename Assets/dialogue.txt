LEVEL 1:
+++
This is commander Harrison, pilot.
We have reports of hostile alien  behaviour.
Medium alien ship near system 0x1A4.
Your job is to find and destroy it, pilot.
Warping you in...
Use arrows to move around.
And space to shoot.
...
I think I warped you to the wrong system, pilot.
Give me some time to find the right coordinates.
...
Oh no...
Asteroid storm incoming!
Watch out! You have only one life, pilot.
---
+++
Hang in there, pilot.
---
+++
Working on it...
---
+++
We are almost there, pilot!
---
+++
Just a few moments!
...
Warping out!
---

LEVEL 2:
+++
...
Hm...
I don't think this is the right place either.
And there is another asteroid storm coming.
The developers really recycled it from level 1.
Oh but there are enemy ships now.
Watch out!
---
+++
Give me a minute...
---
+++
You are doing great, pilot!
+++
This time I have the correct coordinates.
---
+++
Warp drive is ready.
Warping out!
---

LEVEL 3:
+++
This is the correct system now, I promise.
I mean, there are only three levels in the game...
The alien ship is coming any moment.
Watch out!
---
+++
This is it, pilot.
---
+++
You got it!
---
+++
It's almost done. Destroy it!
---
+++
Well done, pilot.
The mission is complete. You are going home.
Commander Harrison singing off.
Warping out.
